This is a website I created for my club FinTechSC (FinTech Club at the University of Southern California). I used Streamlit, a Python library that
allows users to generate HTML, CSS, and Javascript with Python to speed up development.
The website presents information about the club to users and allows users to input their information in order to apply for membership. I used
the Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs to store user input into a Google Sheet, thus using Google Sheets as a backend database (a user friendly database). Some custom CSS and HTML styling was implemented (using Streamlits St.Markdown method) in order to center some text and images. However, most of this website was created using Streamlits core functions.
